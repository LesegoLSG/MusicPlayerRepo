## Introduction

In today's digital age, music streaming has become an integral part of our lives. Our Music Application aims to provide a similar experience to popular streaming services like Spotify, allowing users to navigate through albums and songs effortlessly. Whether you're a casual listener or a music enthusiast, our app is designed to meet your needs with a user-friendly layout, including a sidebar, top navbar, and a main section featuring album and song lists. The application is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices. While the authentication and sign-in options (Google, Facebook, and Apple) are currently UI-only, they set the foundation for future functionality. Enjoy playback controls that allow you to play, pause, skip, and seek your favorite tracks. Join us in exploring this demo version, and stay tuned for more updates and features!
